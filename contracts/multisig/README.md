# Multisig contract

This contract is used by the batcher contract during proof construction to start a signing session and collect signatures from participants.

s--SubmitSignature-->m
b--GetSigningSession-->m
```

- **StartSigningSession**: The multisig contract receives a binary message from the batcher contract. It uses the current active set of keys to link to a new signing session and then emits an event to notify signers that a message is pending signature.
- **SubmitSignature**: Each signer will sign the message using their own private key and then submit the signature to the multisig contract. This process validates that the signer is a participant in the snapshot associated with the active key that was set for the multisig session.
- **GetSigningSession**: Query called by the batcher contract to retrieve the current state of the session, collected signatures so far and the snapshot with participants information. The proof is generated by the batcher contract if the multisig was completed.

## Interface

```Rust
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    StartSigningSession {
        sig_msg: HexBinary,
    },
    SubmitSignature {
        multisig_session_id: Uint64,
        signature: HexBinary,
    },
}

#[derive(QueryResponses)]
pub enum QueryMsg {
    #[returns(GetSigningSessionResponse)]
    GetSigningSession { multisig_session_id: Uint64 },
}

pub struct GetSigningSessionResponse {
    state: MultisigState,
    signatures: HashMap<String, HexBinary>,
    snapshot: Snapshot,
}

pub enum MultisigState {
    Pending,
    Completed,
}
```

## Events

```Rust
// Emitted when a new signing session is open
pub struct SigningStarted {
    pub multisig_session_id: Uint64,
    pub key_set_id: Uint64,
    pub pub_keys: HashMap<String, HexBinary>,
    pub sig_msg: HexBinary,
}

// Emitted when a participants submits a signature
pub struct SignatureSubmitted {
    pub multisig_session_id: Uint64,
    pub participant: Addr,
    pub signature: HexBinary,
}

// Emitted when a signing session was completed
pub struct SigningCompleted {
    pub multisig_session_id: Uint64,
}
```
