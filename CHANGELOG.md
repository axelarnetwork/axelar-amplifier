## [Unreleased](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/tree/HEAD)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/compare/ampd-v1.2.0..HEAD)

- Change event index in message ids from u32 to u64. Emit message id from voting verifier [#666](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/pull/666)
- Ampd switch from horizon to RPC client for Stellar verifier [#694](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/pull/694)

#### v1.3.0 Migration Notes

Components that need upgrading:
ampd

Contracts that need migration:
coordinator
voting-verifier
service-registry
rewards
router
multisig-prover

Contracts that should be redeployed (deploy fresh instance):
interchain-token-service
axelarnet-gateway (deploy with chain name "axelar")

Contracts no longer used (no longer part of the active system):
nexus-gateway

The voting verifier contracts must be migrated before ampd is upgraded. Existing ampd instances will continue to work even after the contract migration, but we recommend upgrading ampd.
