#### Migration Notes
Upgrade or deploy contracts/components in the below order:

##### Contracts that should be deployed fresh
- interchain-token-service
- axelarnet-gateway (deploy with chain name "axelar")

##### Contracts that need migration
- coordinator
- gateway
- rewards
- router
- multisig
- multisig-prover
- service-registry
- voting-verifier

##### Components that need upgrading
- ampd

##### Contracts no longer used (no longer part of the active system)
- nexus-gateway

The voting verifier contracts must be migrated before ampd is upgraded. Existing ampd instances will continue to work even after the contract migration, but we recommend upgrading ampd.
