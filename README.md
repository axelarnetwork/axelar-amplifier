# Axelar Amplifier

The Interchain Amplifier enables developers to permissionlessly set up connections to the Axelar network. Developers gain access to Axelar's interconnected network of chains and can "amplify" their resources by paying the cost equivalent to developing only one connection. They can establish connections between new ecosystems or existing chains to add new network properties, such as improved security or better delivery and availability.

### Documentation

High level documentation and diagrams can be found in the [doc](doc/README.md) directory.

### Contract Json Schemas
Json schemas for types used in the contract apis can be generated by navigating to the `./contracts/{contract_name}` directory and running `cargo schema`. This will generate a `./contracts/{contract_name}/schema` directory containing the json schemas for types used to instantiate, execute, query etc.
