# Axelar Amplifier

The Interchain Amplifier enables developers to permissionlessly set up connections to the Axelar network. Developers gain access to Axelar's interconnected network of chains and can "amplify" their resources by paying the cost equivalent to developing only one connection. They can establish connections between new ecosystems or existing chains to add new network properties, such as improved security or better delivery and availability.

### Documentation

High level documentation and diagrams can be found in the [doc](doc/README.md) directory.

### Contract Json Schemas
Json schemas for types used in the contract apis can be generated by navigating to the `./contracts/{contract_name}` directory and running `cargo schema`. This will generate a `./contracts/{contract_name}/schema` directory containing the json schemas for types used to instantiate, execute, query etc.


### Development and Testing

When developing contracts to integrate with amplifier, the `cw-multi-test` crate can be used to create a simulated blockchain environment, where different contracts can deployed and interacted with, and contracts can interact with each other. See the [integration-tests](integration-tests) package for examples, as well as reusable helper functions.

### Versioning

The semver for new releases is calculated automatically based on the commit messages and the folders where changes were made. The configuration for each piece of software released (e.g ampd, gateway...) can be seen in the release.yaml file. You can perform a dry-run using the release action to be sure that the next version is what you intend it to be. The basic rules are as follows:
 - a commit with a message that does not include any associated tag (e.g major-contracts) for release will be considered a patch release
 - a commit with a message with minor tag e.g `feat(minor-ampd):...` will be considered a minor release, and the same logic applies to major releases
 - if no changes are detected in the watched directories, the release will not bump the version. e.g if since last release for the batching contract, no changes were made in the `contracts/major-batching` or `packages/` directory. A new release will not bump the version.
