# Runs cargo-audit to check for known security vulnerabilities in dependencies
# using the RustSec Advisory Database.
#
# Uses cargo-audit v0.22.0 which supports Cargo.lock version 4 format (Rust 1.86+).
# Runs on all PRs and pushes, not just dependency changes, to catch retroactive
# vulnerabilities on existing dependencies as soon as possible.
