# Connection Router Contract

The connection router contract is responsible for routing messages to and from registered gateways, as well as handling chain registration, gateway upgrades and chain freezing.
<br>
The router admin can freeze and unfreeze a chain for a specified direction, while governance can register a chain and upgrade its gateway.

## Interface

```Rust
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    /*
     * Governance Methods
     * All of the below messages can only be called by governance
     */
    // Registers a new chain with the router
    RegisterChain {
        chain: ChainName,
        gateway_address: String,
    },
    // Changes the gateway address associated with a particular chain
    UpgradeGateway {
        chain: ChainName,
        contract_address: String,
    },

    /*
     * Router Admin Methods
     * All of the below messages can only be called by the router admin
     */
    // Freezes a chain, in the specified direction.
    FreezeChain {
        chain: ChainName,
        direction: GatewayDirection,
    },
    // Unfreezes a chain, in the specified direction.
    UnfreezeChain {
        chain: ChainName,
        direction: GatewayDirection,
    },

    /*
     * Gateway Messages
     * The below messages can only be called by registered gateways
     */
    // Routes each message to the gateway registered to the destination chain.
    // Called by a registered gateway
    RouteMessages(Vec<Message>),
}

pub struct RouterInstantiated {
    pub admin: Addr,
    pub governance: Addr,
    pub nexus_gateway: Addr,
}

pub struct ChainRegistered {
    pub name: ChainName,
    pub gateway: Addr,
}

pub struct GatewayInfo {
    pub chain: ChainName,
    pub gateway_address: Addr,
}

pub struct GatewayUpgraded {
    pub gateway: GatewayInfo,
}

pub struct GatewayFrozen {
    pub gateway: GatewayInfo,
}

pub struct GatewayUnfrozen {
    pub gateway: GatewayInfo,
}

pub struct ChainFrozen {
    pub name: ChainName,
}

pub struct ChainUnfrozen {
    pub name: ChainName,
}

pub struct MessageRouted {
    pub msg: Message,
}
```

```

1. The External Gateway emits an event that is picked up by the Relayer.
2. Relayer relays the event to the Gateway as a message.
3. Gateway receives the incoming messages, verifies the messages, and then passes the messages to the Connection Router.
4. Connection Router sends outgoing messages to the destination Gateway.
5. The Multisig Prover takes the messages stored in the destination Gateway and constructs a proof.
6. The Relayer sends the proof to the destination's External Gateway.
